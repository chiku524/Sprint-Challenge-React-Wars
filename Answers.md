1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
    "React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces."
    It is declarative and component based, which means that it is made up of small and isolated pieces of code. These components make it easy to create complex UIs in a simple manner.

1. Describe component state.
    There is a function called setState() that updates a component's state object. When the state changes, the component re-renders. This is component state. 

1. Describe props.
    Props is short for properties. These properties allow the developer to customize the components with their own variables and pass objects into their compoennets.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?
    Side effects are anything that affects something outside of the scope of the current function that is being executed.
